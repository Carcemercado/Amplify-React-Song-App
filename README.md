## About this project

A React application made following the tutorial on FreeCodeCamp FullStack: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ultimate-guide-to-aws-amplify-and-reacxt/
My goal with this project was to learn more about the React ecosystem as well as AWS Amplify ecosystem.


## Code

html, css, javascript, and jsx - used to edit the app via VS Code.

app.jsx - contains the main app logic.

app.css - contains the basic app styling.

## Tools

AWS Amplify - the AWS service tool used to manage app database, user login verification, and basic structure of the app. Provides IAM, DynamoDB, and other microservices to run the application.

Material UI - a React library that "provides a robust, customizable, and accessible library of foundational and advanced components, enabling you to build your own design system and develop React applications faster".
